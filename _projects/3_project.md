## Introduction

These are short term lectures about quantum mechanics held in Spring 2021, I was the host.

## Content

I have planned to introduce several points of quantum mechanics, including basics concepts, the equations of motion, angular momentum, spin and identity of particles. **Unfortunately, my original plan was interrupted by final exams of medicine courses in that semester, so I had to suspend this seminar such that this lecture is not completed yet. I will finish it as soon as possible.**
