## Introduction

These are short term lectures about classical electrodynamics. The seminar is held annually United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates, and I was the host of 2021 winter electrodynamics seminar.

## Content

I have introduced several points of electrodynamics, including **special relativity, electromagnetic field equations, the field of moving charges and radiation damping, and the limits of applicability of classical electrodynamics.**

## Reference

*Course of Theoretical Physics Volume 2, The Classical Theory of Fields* by L. D. Landau
