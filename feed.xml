During the winter last year, I had to stay at home due to the abrupt outbreak of COVID-19 in China, so I read some history books, and this is one of them.</p> <p>The most striking point Wickham mentioned in this book is that the formation of identification or some kind of nationalism of inhabitants in several Post-Rome kingdoms in western Europe, i.e., Lombard Kingdom, Visigothic Kingdom, and Merovingian Kingdoms, was indeed still <em>Latin</em>, the native language of most of whom was very similar to antiquity, and only one or two generations before whose identification had been Roman. How did the change happen, that the inhabitants identified themselves as Lombard and Visigoth instead of Roman when they were not even capable of speaking the Gothic language?</p> <p>Wickham gave an interesting explanation that nationalism emerged not only from a common language and culture, through which nationalism was often formed, but also from something else, such as following the same great general/king who would bring wealth and peace to this area (actually a former province of Western Rome, later kingdoms). This king might lead inhabitants to war, make his own coins, distribute estates to aristocrats, in addition to the economic localization of West Mediterranean caused by late antiquity geopolitics. So people began to identify themselves with the new king/general, and Visigoths replaced Roman.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="European-history"/><category term="hobby"/><category term="history"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a first blog for test]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with code</title><link href="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2015/code/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with code"/><published>2015-07-15T15:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-07-15T15:09:00+00:00</updated><id>https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2015/code</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2015/code/"><![CDATA[<p>In this blog I will introduce myself and explain why I plan to apply for master/PhD in physics.</p> <p>I entered Xi’an Jiaotong University and enrolled in the program of bachelor of medicine in September, 2019. Nevertheless, I found it not so interesting to study medicine, of which courses include few mathematics and physics so that it was not like a natural science, which I prefer to study. It only made things worse for me that my university then prohibited students from attending lectures on campuses other than the one associated with their major.</p> <p>In order to find a way to fill the gap between my major and what I want to learn, in September 2019 I tried to join Prof Wei Wei’s 2D material research group as an undergraduate to develop a new method to produce high-quality graphene, which can be used to attend Xi’an Jiaotong University ‘Tengfei Cup’ Technology Innovation Competition. I invited 5 stusents from physics major, mechanics major and biology major and organized a little group to push forward the research.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a blog post with some code]]></summary></entry></feed>
