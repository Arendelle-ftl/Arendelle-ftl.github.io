## United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates
### Introduction
I developed and co-organized this communication platform designed for undergraduates from various universities, fostering collaboration and engagement in basic science research. Now the members of United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates include student organizations from Nanjing University([NJU](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/)), Shanghai Jiaotong University([SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)), University of Science and Technology of China([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)) and Xi'an Jiaotong University([XJTU](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)), and the Forum is cooperating with [Chaoli Forum](https://chaoli.club/).
