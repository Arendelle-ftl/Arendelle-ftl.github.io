	title={Stability of the Potential Super Jupiter in Alpha Centauri System},
	author={Feng, Tinglong},
	journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.19177},
	year={2024},
	abstract={The stability of potential exoplanets in binary star systems remains a critical challenge in celestial mechanics. This study investigates the stability of a hypothetical Jupiter-mass planet in the Alpha Centauri AB system by drawing parallels with the recently detected Neptune-mass planet in the GJ65AB system, which shares similar mass ratios and orbital eccentricities. Utilizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem and the Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) parameter within the REBOUND software package, we perform numerical simulations to identify stable orbital configurations. Our results indicate that a Jupiter-mass planet could theoretically maintain a stable orbit in Alpha Centauri AB, with orbital parameters derived from the stable zones observed in GJ65AB. Despite the absence of observational evidence for such a planet in Alpha Centauri AB, this study suggests that similar binary systems could exhibit analogous stability characteristics. Future observational efforts are recommended to explore this potential and refine our understanding of planetary formation in binary star systems.},

	abstract={In this article we explore the holographic approach to neutron stars in the realm of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). We delve into the structures of neutron stars, emphasizing the application of the AdS/CFT duality in modeling them. We discuss both "bottom-up" and "top-down" holographic models, comparing their predictions with astrophysical observations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential broader applications of the holography method in areas like superconductivity, highlighting the methodological significance of string theory and QFT in astrophysics.},
