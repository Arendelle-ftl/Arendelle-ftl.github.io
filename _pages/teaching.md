## Courses
*Note: Due to my university's previous policy, which prohibited students from attending lectures on campuses other than the one associated with their major, I am unable to enroll in core physics courses until the autumn semester of 2023.* ***Nevertheless, according to my plan, I will have obtained grades for all the listed courses before my graduation.***
