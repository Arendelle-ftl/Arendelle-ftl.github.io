- Abstract: In this work, we innovated traditional electrochemical exfoliation methods to produce high-quality graphene. By **modifying an electrolytic cell with graphite sheets and employing an electric field**, we achieved better ion intercalation. Our physical modeling and Raman spectroscopy confirmed **less defective graphene** compared to conventional methods. A subsequent design using an **organic-aqueous parallel exfoliation** method yielded **thinner graphene layers**, which is supported by SEM characterization further enhancing the quality of the produced graphene.
- Key words: Graphene production, electrochemical exfoliation, physical modeling.
