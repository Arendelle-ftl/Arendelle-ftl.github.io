My name is Tinglong Feng (冯廷龙 in Chinese). I am an undergraduate student from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in clinic medicine. Despite that, my academic interest is physics, and I have independently completed most of the foundational mathematics and physics courses typically required for a physics major, including Analytical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics.

I have research experience in graphene production, during which I learned basic physics and organized seminars, and in health economics modeling, where I became familiar with Mathematica and MATLAB. I will get my Bachelor of Medicine degree in July 2024. Now I am applying for Master/PhD in physics, biophysics or biomedical engineering to continue my education and research. 

My hobbies are reading history books and fantasy literatures. I find it fascinating to explore the uniformity and complexity in European history, and I was so attracted by the fantasy world created by Tolkien that I learned a little Quenya language.
