## Basic Information

### Purpose

I hold this seminar in April 2020, when I was still staying at home and attending lectures online due to the first outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The purpose of the seminars was to lead members of my graphene research group to learn fundamental knowlege of theoretical physics so that we can push forward our research through theoretical computation without getting into the lab.

### Content

I have introduced core points of analytical mechanics, i.e., **Lagrangian mechanics** and **Hamiltonian mechanics**, including principle of least action, Euler–Lagrange equation, symmetry and conservation law, Legendre transformation, Hamilton's canonical equation, Maupertuis's principle and Hamilton–Jacobi equation.

### Reference

*Course of Theoretical Physics Volume 1, Mechanics* by L. D. Landau
