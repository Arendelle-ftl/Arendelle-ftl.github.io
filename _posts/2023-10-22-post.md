In this blog I will introduce myself and explain why I plan to apply for master/PhD in physics. 

I entered Xi'an Jiaotong University and enrolled in the program of bachelor of medicine in September, 2019. Nevertheless, I found it not so interesting to study medicine, of which courses include few mathematics and physics so that it was not like a natural science, which I prefer to study. It only made things worse for me that my university then prohibited students from attending lectures on campuses other than the one associated with their major.

In order to find a way to fill the gap between my major and what I want to learn, in September 2019 I tried to join Prof Wei Wei's 2D material research group as an undergraduate to develop a new method to produce high-quality graphene, which can be used to attend Xi'an Jiaotong University 'Tengfei Cup' Technology Innovation Competition. I invited 5 stusents from physics major, mechanics major and biology major and organized a little group to push forward the research.
