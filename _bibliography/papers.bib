	year={2024},
	abstract={In this article we explore the holographic approach to neutron stars in the realm of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). We delve into the structures of neutron stars, emphasizing the application of the AdS/CFT duality in modeling them. We discuss both "bottom-up" and "top-down" holographic models, comparing their predictions with astrophysical observations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential broader applications of the holography method in areas like superconductivity, highlighting the methodological significance of string theory and QFT in astrophysics.}
