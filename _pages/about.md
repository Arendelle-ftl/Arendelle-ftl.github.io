My name is Tinglong Feng (冯廷龙 in Chinese). I am a master student from [Institute for Theoretical Physics, Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-theoretical-physics). Despite getting Bachelor of Medicine from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), my academic interest is astrophysics. I have research experience in [cosmology](https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/research/3_project/), where I explored the in-in formalism for pseudo-hermitian systems. I was also attracted by [Holographic Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01617v1) and [planet systems stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19177v1) and wrote related term papers for theoretical physics courses I attended as an undergraduate. **Now I am finding research opportunities in astrophysics area, and planning to apply for a PhD position to continue my education and research.** 

My hobbies are reading history books and fantasy literatures. I find it fascinating to explore the uniformity and complexity in European history, and I was so attracted by the fantasy world created by Tolkien that I learned a little Quenya language.
