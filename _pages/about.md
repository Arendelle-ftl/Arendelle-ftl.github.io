My name is Tinglong Feng (冯廷龙), and I am a master's student at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics, Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-theoretical-physics). Originally trained in medicine at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), my passion lies in astrophysics. My research spans [cosmology](https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/research/3_project/), where I explored the in-in formalism for pseudo-Hermitian systems, as well as [Holographic Neutron Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01617v1) and [planetary system stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19177v1). **I am currently seeking research opportunities in astrophysics and planning to pursue a PhD to advance my research career.**

My hobbies are reading history books and fantasy literatures. I find it fascinating to explore the uniformity and complexity in European history, and I was so attracted by the fantasy world created by Tolkien that I learned a little Quenya language.
