In this blog I will introduce myself and explain why I plan to apply for master/PhD in physics. 

I entered Xi'an Jiaotong University(XJTU) and enrolled in the program of bachelor of medicine in September, 2019. Nevertheless, I found it not so interesting to study medicine, of which courses include few mathematics and physics so that it was not like a natural science, which I prefer to study. It only made things worse for me that my university then prohibited students from attending lectures on campuses other than the one associated with their major.

In order to find a way to fill the gap between my major and what I want to learn, in September 2019 I tried to join Prof Wei Wei's 2D material research group as an undergraduate to develop a new method to produce high-quality graphene, which can be used to attend XJTU 'Tengfei Cup' Technology Innovation Competition. I invited 5 stusents from physics major, mechanics major and biology major and organized a little group to push forward the research. Our aim was to innovate traditional electrochemical exfoliation method to produce high-quality graphene, while making a Quantum-Chemical Calculation to confirm the validity of this new method. We had tried some failed experiments in autumn 2019.  


Due to the first national wide outbreak of COVID-19 in China, I had to stay at home from winter vacation to May 2020. During this period, none of the members of my little research group could get into laboratory, so we dicided to advance the theoretical direction. I planned to lead my group to complete the core contents of theoretical physics courses quickly, so I read *Landau Vol. 1* to learn analytical mechanics first. During my reading, I found it so amazing to constrcut a whole teoretical system from principle of least action that I was deeply attracted by theoretical physics. In April 2020 I held [Analytical Mechanics Seminar](https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/projects/1_project/) online with my little group. When I came back to university, I decided to try to learn more physics.


In Autumn 2020, I advance the graphene production research with my group members by modifying an electrolytic cell by replacing the membrane between the anode and cathode chambers with graphite sheets and employing an electric field. On top of that, we wish to conduct physical modeling to explain the method, so we plan to learn electrodynamics. Meanwhile, I realized that it would be very difficult to advance theretical physcis learning when I wasn't allowed to attend physcs lectures then, so I contacted undergraduates from University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) and Nanjing University(NJU) to create a communication platform to foster collaboration and engagement in basic science research.
