My name is Tinglong Feng (冯廷龙 in Chinese). I am an undergraduate student from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in clinic medicine. Despite that, my academic interest is physics, and I have learned most basic mathematics and physics courses which undergraduates in [the School of Physics](https://phy.xjtu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) should have taken, such as Calculus, Analytical Mechanics, Electrodynamics and Quantum Mechanics. 

I have research experiences in 2D material production, through which I learned basic physics courses and organized seminars, and in health economics modeling, through which I got familiar with Mathematica/MATLAB. I will get my Bachelor of Medicine degree on July 2024. Now I am applying for Master/PhD in physics, biophysics or biomedical engineering to continue my education and research. 

My hobbies are reading history books and fantacy literatures. It is amazing for me to expolre uniformity and complexity in European history, and I was so attracted by the fatacy world crated by Tolkien that I learned a little Quenya language.
