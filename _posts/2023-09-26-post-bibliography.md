This is a test post where I shall write someting interesting about the forming of nationalism in early medieval Europe, point of which I first got in the second book of *The Penguin History of Europe*, *The Inheritance of Rome, A History of Europe from 400 to 1000* by Chris Wickham. During the Winter last year I had to stay at home due to the abrupt outbreak of COVID-19 in China so I read some history books, and this is one of them.


The most striking point Wickham mentioned in this book is that the forming of identification or some kind of **nationalism** of inhabitants in several post-Rome kingdoms in western Europe, i.e., Lombard Kingdom, Visigothic Kingdom, and Merovingian Kingdoms, native languge of most of whom was indeed still *Latin*, culture of whom was very similar to antiquity, and only one or two generation befor whose identification had been Roman. How did the change, that the inhabitants identified themselves Lombard and Visigoth in stead of Roman when they were not even capable of speaking Gothic language, happen? 


Wickham gave an interesting explanation, that nationalism emerged not only from common languge and culture, through which nationalism was often formed, but also from something else, such as following the same great genral/king who would bring wealth and peace to this area (actually former province of Wetern Rome, later kingdoms ). This king might lead inhabitants to war, make his own coins, distribute estate to aristocrats, in addition to the economical localization of West Mediterranean caused by late antiquity geopolitics, people began to identify themselves with the new king/general, and visigohts replaced Roman.
