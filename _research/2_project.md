- Abstract: In this work, we employ mathematical modeling to analyze government funding allocation between clinical treatment and preventive medicine during epidemics. Findings suggest prioritizing clinical treatment for diseases like influenza with high prevalence and recovery rates, while prioritizing preventive medicine for low prevalence and recovery rate diseases like cancer. The comparison between disease prevalence and mortality rates should guide funding in cases of high prevalence but low recovery rate diseases. Historical data and past epidemic case examples substantiate our conclusions.
