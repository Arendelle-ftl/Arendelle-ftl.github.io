<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>My name is Tinglong Feng(冯廷龙 in Chinese). I am an undergraduate student from <a href="http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xi’an Jiaotong University</a>, majoring in clinic medicine. Despite that, my academic interest is physics, and I have learned most basic mathematics and physics courses which undergraduates in <a href="https://phy.xjtu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the School of Physics</a> should have taken, such as Calculus, Analytical Mechanics, Electrodynamics and Quantum Mechanics.</p> <p>I have research experience in 2D material production, through which I learned basic physics courses and organized seminars, and in health economics modeling, through which I got familiar with Mathematica/MATLAB. I will get my Bachelor of Medicine degree on July 2024. Now I am applying for Master/PhD in physics, biophysics or biomedical engineering to continue my education and research.</p> <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I love reding history books and fantacy literatures. I found it amazing to expolre uniformity and complexity in European history, and I was so attracted by the fatacy world crated by Tolkien that I learned a little Quenya language.</p> </body></html>
