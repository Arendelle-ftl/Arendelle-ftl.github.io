Nevertheless, I found it not so interesting to study medicine, of which courses include few mathematics and physics so that it was not like a natural science, which I prefer to study. It only made things worse for me that my university then prohibited students from attending lectures on campuses other than the one associated with their major.</p> <p>In order to find a way to fill the gap between my major and what I want to learn, in September 2019 I tried to join Prof Wei Wei’s 2D material research group as an undergraduate to develop a new method to produce high-quality graphene, which can be used to attend XJTU ‘Tengfei Cup’ Technology Innovation Competition. I invited 5 stusents from physics major, mechanics major and biology major and organized a little group to push forward the research. Our aim was to innovate traditional electrochemical exfoliation method to produce high-quality graphene, while making a Quantum-Chemical Calculation to confirm the validity of this new method. We had tried some failed experiments in autumn 2019.</p> <p>Due to the first national wide outbreak of COVID-19 in China, I had to stay at home from winter vacation to May 2020. During this period, none of the members of my little research group could get into laboratory, so we dicided to advance the theoretical direction. I planned to lead my group to complete the core contents of theoretical physics courses quickly, so I read <em>Landau Vol. 1</em> to learn analytical mechanics first. During my reading, I found it so amazing to constrcut a whole teoretical system from principle of least action that I was deeply attracted by theoretical physics. In April 2020 I held <a href="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/projects/1_project/">Analytical Mechanics Seminar</a> online with my little group. When I came back to university, I decided to try to learn more physics.</p> <p>In Autumn 2020, I advanced the graphene production research together with my group members by modifying an electrolytic cell by replacing the membrane between the anode and cathode chambers with graphite sheets and employing an electric field. On top of that, we wish to conduct physical modeling to explain the method, so we plan to learn electrodynamics. Meanwhile, I realized that it would be very difficult to advance theretical physcis learning when I wasn’t allowed to attend physcs lectures then, so I contacted undergraduates from University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) and Nanjing University(NJU) to create a communication platform named ‘inter-university forum of science’ to foster collaboration and engagement in basic science research. In December 2020 the forum organized <a href="https://chaoli.club/index.php/5917">the first research experience sharing activities</a>， after attending which I found my interest may lie in astrophysics or theretical physics. In February 2021, the forum organized <a href="https://chaoli.club/index.php/6119">winter seminars</a> in which I held <a href="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/projects/2_project/">classical electrodynamics seminar</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="academics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a self-introduction]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nationalism in early medieval Europe</title><link href="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2023/test-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nationalism in early medieval Europe"/><published>2023-09-26T23:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-26T23:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2023/test-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arendelle-ftl.github.io/blog/2023/test-post/"><![CDATA[<p>This is a test post where I shall write something interesting about the formation of nationalism in early medieval Europe, a point which I first got in the second book of <em>The Penguin History of Europe</em>, <em>The Inheritance of Rome, A History of Europe from 400 to 1000</em> by Chris Wickham. During the winter last year, I had to stay at home due to the abrupt outbreak of COVID-19 in China, so I read some history books, and this is one of them.</p> <p>The most striking point Wickham mentioned in this book is that the formation of identification or some kind of nationalism of inhabitants in several Post-Rome kingdoms in western Europe, i.e., Lombard Kingdom, Visigothic Kingdom, and Merovingian Kingdoms, was indeed still <em>Latin</em>, the native language of most of whom was very similar to antiquity, and only one or two generations before whose identification had been Roman. How did the change happen, that the inhabitants identified themselves as Lombard and Visigoth instead of Roman when they were not even capable of speaking the Gothic language?</p> <p>Wickham gave an interesting explanation that nationalism emerged not only from a common language and culture, through which nationalism was often formed, but also from something else, such as following the same great general/king who would bring wealth and peace to this area (actually a former province of Western Rome, later kingdoms). This king might lead inhabitants to war, make his own coins, distribute estates to aristocrats, in addition to the economic localization of West Mediterranean caused by late antiquity geopolitics. So people began to identify themselves with the new king/general, and Visigoths replaced Roman.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="European-history"/><category term="hobby"/><category term="history"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a first blog for test]]></summary></entry></feed>
