- Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian system is a class of non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian satisfying the condition $$H^\dag=\eta^{-1}H\eta$$. We develop the in-in formalism to calculate cosmological correlation functions for pseudo-Hermitian systems. Sample calculations of the power spectrum of pseudo-Hermitian systems-symplectic scalar and spin-half boson is given. We have also derived the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism for pseudo-Hermitian systems.
